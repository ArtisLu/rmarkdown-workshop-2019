# Customising your output

???
we'll look at this in two ways
- using YAML options to directly customise the output (you might use this for yourself or you might want to create a template that students should download and fill in)
- adopting a publisher's LaTeX (or Word) template for use with R Markdown

---
## Simple customisation via YAML header

- Many simple customisation options are easily set in the YAML header

--
- The options available depend on the output format (HTML, PDF, etc.), see [bookdown.org](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/documents.html)

--
- Let's have a look at some common options...


---
### Table of contents

.pull-left[
```yaml
---
title: "Output customisation"
output: 
  bookdown::html_document2:
*    toc: true
---
```
]

--
.pull-right[
```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/html_toc.png")
```
]


---
### Table of contents

.pull-left[
```yaml
---
title: "Output customisation"
output: 
  bookdown::html_document2:
    toc: true
*   toc_float: true
---
```
]

--
.pull-right[
```{r}
include_graphics("figures/html_toc_float.png")
```
]

---
### Table of contents

.pull-left[
```yaml
---
title: "Output customisation"
output: 
*  bookdown::pdf_document2:
    toc: true
---
```
]

--
.pull-right[
```{r}
include_graphics("figures/pdf_toc.png")
```
]

---
### Table of contents

.pull-left[
```yaml
---
title: "Output customisation"
output: 
*  bookdown::word_document2:
    toc: true
---
```
]

--
.pull-right[
```{r}
include_graphics("figures/word_toc.png")
```
]

---
### Putting content in tabs in HTML output
- Add `{.tabset}` after a header to make all sub-headers of the header appear within tabs instead of as standalone sections.


--
.pull-left[

For example:

```markdown
# Test header {.tabset}

## Including tables

(tab content)

## Including plots

(tab content)

```

]

--
.pull-right[
```{r, out.width="80%"}
include_graphics("figures/html_tabset.png")
```

]

---
## Appearance and style
- For HTML, you can use `theme` or a custom **.css** style sheet

--
- `theme` options (see them at [bootswatch.com](https://bootswatch.com/)) : *“cerulean”, “journal”, “flatly”, “darkly”, “readable”, “spacelab”, “united”, “cosmo”, “lumen”, “paper”, “sandstone”, “simplex”, “yeti”*


--
.pull-left[
For example:
```yaml
---
title: "Output customisation"
output: 
  bookdown::html_document2:
    toc: true
    toc_float: true
    theme: darkly
---
```
]


.pull-right[
```{r, out.width="75%"}
include_graphics("figures/html_theme.png")
```

]

---
## Appearance and style
- For fine-grained control, you can supply a template for pandoc to use for the output document:

```yaml
---
title: "Output customisation"
output: 
  bookdown::html_document2:
*    template: my_template.html
  bookdown::pdf_document2:
*    template: my_template.tex
  bookdown::word_document2:
*    reference_docx: my-styles.docx
---
```

--
- For more on HTML templates, see the [pandoc documentation](http://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#templates) and/or have a look at the [default HTML template](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc-templates/blob/master/default.html5)
- For more on Word templates, watch this short video ([vimeo.com/110804387](https://vimeo.com/110804387)), or read this article ([rmarkdown.rstudio.com/articles_docx.html](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/articles_docx.html))

---
## Using LaTeX templates with R Markdown

--
- The [`rticles`](https://github.com/rstudio/rticles) package contains a range of ready-made templates for submissions to a various journals

--
- At the moment, however, many of the templates are not well documented, and it can be difficult to understand what's going on under the hood

--
- It's useful to understand a bit of how it works, for when you find yourself needing to submit something formatted with LaTeX but wish to write in R Markdown (the concept is similar for html templates)

--
- Let's have a look at the [PLOS LaTeX template](http://www.latextemplates.com/template/public-library-of-science-plos)


---
## Using LaTeX templates with R Markdown
.pull-left[
```yaml
---
output: 
  bookdown::pdf_document2:
    template: plos_latex_template.tex
---
```
]


--
.pull-right[
```{r}
include_graphics("figures/template_error.png")
```
]

---
class: center, middle, inverse

![](figures/rmarkdownflow.png)

---
## plos_latex_template.tex
- A dollar sign has special meaning for `pandoc` - when it creates the output, it looks for stuff wrapped in dollar signs and assumes should plug in something from your **.Rmd** file

--
- In `pandoc`, a `$` is escaped with another `$`


--
.pull-left[
If we take a look at line 57 in **plos_latex_template.tex** we see this:
```latex
% For example, x$^2$ is incorrect; 
this should be formatted as $x^2$ 
(or $\mathrm{x}^2$ if the romanized font is desired).
```
]


--
.pull-right[
- We change to this:<br>
<br>

```latex
% For example, x$$^2$$ is incorrect; 
this should be formatted as $$x^2$$ 
(or $$\mathrm{x}^2$$ if the romanized font is desired).
```
]


---
## plos_latex_template.tex
- A dollar sign has special meaning for `pandoc` - when it creates the output, it looks for stuff wrapped in dollar signs and assumes should plug in something from your **.Rmd** file
- In `pandoc`, a `$` is escaped with another `$`

.pull-left[

this should be formatted as $x^2$ 
(or $\mathrm{x}^2$ if the romanized font is desired).
```
]

.pull-right[
- Now we get this - seems like we fixed the error, but that there's a few more:

```{r}
include_graphics("figures/template_error2.png")
```
]

---
## plos_latex_template.tex
- Fix this throughout and we finally get what we'd expect:


--
.pull-left[

```yaml
---
output: 
  bookdown::pdf_document2:
    template: plos_latex_template_adapted.tex
---
```

```{r, out.width="90%", fig.align='center'}
include_graphics("figures/template_escapes.png")
```


]


--
.pull-right[

```{r}
include_graphics("figures/template_compiled.png")
```
]

---
## Plug in information from our **.Rmd** file into the template
- Wrap variables from the YAML header in `$`'s to insert them in the template, e.g. `$author$`

--
- The content after the YAML header is referred to with `$body$`


--
.pull-left[
```latex

# Workflows, collaboration, teaching

???
- Okay, so let's talk about how r markdown fits into concrete workflows
- we'll start with the structure you go through when analysing data
- then we'll work our way out to how you collaborate with others
- and then finally how these general workflows apply to teaching
- this part is going to be more discussion based - we'll have you dicuss what you do, and then I'll put forward best practices as per the people whose advice I follow within the R community

- Explain this
- We'll take 5 minutes for you in pairs to walk through what you actually do when you go through this process - be as concrete as possible! Where do you save your files? Do you use separate scripts for different parts of the analysis etc.? (after 2.5 minutes we swith)
- (get a couple of people to share what they do)
- now i'll annotate this and point you to some best practices

> One day you will have multiple analyses going that use R and you want to keep them separate.<br>

# Collaboration

- Similarly, we'll take 5 minutes for you in pairs to walk through how you currently collaborate with other people on analysing results and writing them up 
- Which file sharing tools do you use? How do you know what's the current version? etc.

### Version control

- structure this in accordance with what you put in the keynote slides

???
1. show the pipeline flowchart and get them to tell each other in pairs what they usually do - then afterwards I'll bring up some of the condensed wisdom of the R community (which should apply across whatever languages you use), and talk about how R Markdown fits in
2. Here's a nice example of r markdown from start to finish: https://github.com/EvaMaeRey/from_raw_data_to_paper_and_presentation
