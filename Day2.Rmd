# Customising your output

???
we'll look at this in two ways
- using YAML options to directly customise the output (you might use this for yourself or you might want to create a template that students should download and fill in)
- adopting a publisher's LaTeX (or Word) template for use with R Markdown

---
## Simple customisation via YAML header

- Many simple customisation options are easily set in the YAML header

--
- The options available depend on the output format (HTML, PDF, etc.), see [bookdown.org](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/documents.html)

--
- Let's have a look at some common options...


---
### Table of contents

.pull-left[
```yaml
---
title: "Output customisation"
output: 
  bookdown::html_document2:
*    toc: true
---
```
]

--
.pull-right[
```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/html_toc.png")
```
]


---
### Table of contents

.pull-left[
```yaml
---
title: "Output customisation"
output: 
  bookdown::html_document2:
    toc: true
*   toc_float: true
---
```
]

--
.pull-right[
```{r}
include_graphics("figures/html_toc_float.png")
```
]

---
### Table of contents

.pull-left[
```yaml
---
title: "Output customisation"
output: 
*  bookdown::pdf_document2:
    toc: true
---
```
]

--
.pull-right[
```{r}
include_graphics("figures/pdf_toc.png")
```
]

---
### Table of contents

.pull-left[
```yaml
---
title: "Output customisation"
output: 
*  bookdown::word_document2:
    toc: true
---
```
]

--
.pull-right[
```{r}
include_graphics("figures/word_toc.png")
```
]

---
### Putting content in tabs in HTML output
- Add `{.tabset}` after a header to make all sub-headers of the header appear within tabs instead of as standalone sections.


--
.pull-left[

For example:

```markdown
# Test header {.tabset}

## Including tables

(tab content)

## Including plots

(tab content)

```

]

--
.pull-right[
```{r, out.width="80%"}
include_graphics("figures/html_tabset.png")
```

]

---
## Appearance and style
- For HTML, you can use `theme` or a custom **.css** style sheet

--
- `theme` options (see them at [bootswatch.com](https://bootswatch.com/)) : *“cerulean”, “journal”, “flatly”, “darkly”, “readable”, “spacelab”, “united”, “cosmo”, “lumen”, “paper”, “sandstone”, “simplex”, “yeti”*


--
.pull-left[
For example:
```yaml
---
title: "Output customisation"
output: 
  bookdown::html_document2:
    toc: true
    toc_float: true
    theme: darkly
---
```
]


.pull-right[
```{r, out.width="75%"}
include_graphics("figures/html_theme.png")
```

]

---
## Appearance and style
- For fine-grained control, you can supply a template for pandoc to use for the output document:

```yaml
---
title: "Output customisation"
output: 
  bookdown::html_document2:
*    template: my_template.html
  bookdown::pdf_document2:
*    template: my_template.tex
  bookdown::word_document2:
*    reference_docx: my-styles.docx
---
```

--
- For more on HTML templates, see the [pandoc documentation](http://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#templates) and/or have a look at the [default HTML template](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc-templates/blob/master/default.html5)
- For more on Word templates, watch this short video ([vimeo.com/110804387](https://vimeo.com/110804387)), or read this article ([rmarkdown.rstudio.com/articles_docx.html](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/articles_docx.html))

---
## Using LaTeX templates with R Markdown

--
- The [`rticles`](https://github.com/rstudio/rticles) package contains a range of ready-made templates for submissions to a various journals

--
- At the moment, however, many of the templates are not well documented, and it can be difficult to understand what's going on under the hood

--
- It's useful to understand a bit of how it works, for when you find yourself needing to submit something formatted with LaTeX but wish to write in R Markdown (the concept is similar for html templates)

--
- Let's have a look at the [PLOS LaTeX template](http://www.latextemplates.com/template/public-library-of-science-plos)


---
## Using LaTeX templates with R Markdown
.pull-left[
```yaml
---
output: 
  bookdown::pdf_document2:
    template: plos_latex_template.tex
---
```
]


--
.pull-right[
```{r}
include_graphics("figures/template_error.png")
```
]

---
class: center, middle, inverse

![](figures/rmarkdownflow.png)

---
## plos_latex_template.tex
- A dollar sign has special meaning for `pandoc` - when it creates the output, it looks for stuff wrapped in dollar signs and assumes should plug in something from your **.Rmd** file

--
- In `pandoc`, a `$` is escaped with another `$`


--
.pull-left[
If we take a look at line 57 in **plos_latex_template.tex** we see this:
```latex
% For example, x$^2$ is incorrect; 
this should be formatted as $x^2$ 
(or $\mathrm{x}^2$ if the romanized font is desired).
```
]


--
.pull-right[
- We change to this:<br>
<br>

```latex
% For example, x$$^2$$ is incorrect; 
this should be formatted as $$x^2$$ 
(or $$\mathrm{x}^2$$ if the romanized font is desired).
```
]


---
## plos_latex_template.tex
- A dollar sign has special meaning for `pandoc` - when it creates the output, it looks for stuff wrapped in dollar signs and assumes should plug in something from your **.Rmd** file
- In `pandoc`, a `$` is escaped with another `$`

.pull-left[

(or $\mathrm{x}^2$ if the romanized font is desired).
```
]

.pull-right[
- Now we get this - seems like we fixed the error, but that there's a few more:

```{r}
include_graphics("figures/template_error2.png")
```
]

---
## plos_latex_template.tex
- Fix this throughout and we finally get what we'd expect:


--
.pull-left[

```yaml
---
output: 
  bookdown::pdf_document2:
    template: plos_latex_template_adapted.tex
---
```

```{r, out.width="90%", fig.align='center'}
include_graphics("figures/template_escapes.png")
```


]


--
.pull-right[

```{r}
include_graphics("figures/template_compiled.png")
```
]

---
## Plug in information from our **.Rmd** file into the template
- Wrap variables from the YAML header in `$`'s to insert them in the template, e.g. `$author$`

--
- The content after the YAML header is referred to with `$body$`


--
.pull-left[
```latex

# Workflows, collaboration, teaching

???
- Okay, so let's talk about how r markdown fits into concrete workflows
- we'll start with the structure you go through when analysing data
- then we'll work our way out to how you collaborate with others
- and then finally how these general workflows apply to teaching
- this part is going to be more discussion based - we'll have you dicuss what you do, and then I'll put forward best practices as per the people whose advice I follow within the R community

???
- Explain this
- We'll take 5 minutes for you in pairs to walk through what you actually do when you go through this process - be as concrete as possible! Where do you save your files? Do you use separate scripts for different parts of the analysis etc.? (after 2.5 minutes we swith)
- (get a couple of people to share what they do)
- now i'll annotate this and point you to some best practices

> One day you will need to quit R, go do something else and return to your analysis later, perhaps months or years later.<br>


--
> One day you will have multiple analyses going that use R and you want to keep them separate.<br>


--
> One day you will need to hand an analysis over to someone else to critique, extend, or reuse.<br>


--
> One day you will need to bring data from the outside world into R and send numerical results and figures from R back out into the world.



--
>To handle these real life situations, you need to make two decisions:

- Which file sharing tools do you use? How do you know what's the current version? etc.

# Suggestions from the R community

### Student assignment submissions with R Markdown 

--
> For teaching statistics, I ask students to submit R Markdown files and a knitted version with echo = TRUE as a global option. <br>

--
> This has made grading assignments so much easier, and the students can work in one document to analyze AND interpret data (rather than working in R console, and copying/pasting R code and output into a text editor or Word document, then adding narrative).

- Free to use (for now)
