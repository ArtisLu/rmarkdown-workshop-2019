# Notebook example
This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots
You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
qplot(Sepal.Length, Petal.Length, data = iris, color = Species, size = Petal.Width)
```

Here is a logo

```{r, out.width="40%", fig.cap="R Markdown logo"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/rmarkdown.png")
```

What about this?
```{r}
cars %>% 
  head() %>% 
  knitr::kable(caption = "A knitr kable table")
```
